Hello there!

I'm a linguist, and I'm interested in social variation in language and language acquisition. My PhD project focuses on variation in child-directed speech and its impact on phonological acquisition in bilingual children. I am also currently part of a project that explores the effects of wearing face masks on speech processing.

**Here are some of my academic interests**

* Phonological acquisition in first and second languages
* Properties of and variation in child-directed speech
* Bilingualism
* Speech variability
* Social variation in language
* Language contact, dialects and ethnolinguistic repertoires


I completed a BA (Hons) in Education at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and went on to obtain an MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Prof. Francis Nolan. After which, I worked for the Ministry of Education for three years, first as a teacher at Anglican High School, and then as a
Curriculum Planning Officer at headquarters. I am currently a final-year PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Brechtje Post](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/professor-brechtje-post).

Also, I really love food.
